[ real ]
moves pen to point ([x],[y])

C[color]
where [color] is

[NAME] - name of color from a color defs section
[R,G,B] - red, green, blue components
[[null]] - no color
sets fill to [color]

S[color]
sets stroke to [color]

R[r]
where [r] is
[ real > 0 ]
draws a circle with radius [r]

B[w],[h]
where [w] and [h] are
[ real > 0 ]
draws a centered box with width [w] and height [h]

P[points]
where [points] is
[[ [x1],[y1] ; {...} [xn],[yn] ]]
draws a polygon with specified points

O[rotation]
where [rotation] is
[ real ]

E
ends the object

U[#]
where [#] is the number of a previously defined object
adds the specified object using relative coordinates

L
pushes the current style onto the stack

K
pops a style off of the stack

F ||
F[N]{[params]}
where [N] is
[[ NAME ]]
where [params] is
[[ NAME [ , ... | ?[##] ] ]]
if "...,?,..." is used, all parameters following the "?"
become optional, "?" becomes "?0"
the [##] is used to check for which optional groups have been provided
defines a parameterized template

J[N]{[params]}
where [params] is
[[ NAME=VALUE [, ...] ]]
uses a parameterized template

A[SUB]
assertions
where [SUB] is
[[ PX, ... ]]
[[PX]] - assert that at most one of the given optional groups was provided

Q[SUB]
queries/conditionals
where [SUB] is
[[ QE, QP, QNP, ... ]]
[[QE]] - end conditional
[[QP]] - optional group provided
[[QNP]] - optional group not provided

when a command ID is lowercase, the coordinates become local, if applicable
